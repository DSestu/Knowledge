# David Sestu's Knowledge repo

This repository contains various bits of knowledge that I find helpful for my work.

This may include code snippets, links, but also articles in the future.

These bits of knowledge are mainly focused on data subjects via Python/PostgresSQL.

My repositories:

1. Python project template

[https://github.com/DSestu/python-project-template](https://github.com/DSestu/python-project-template)

This repository aims to make the development experience smooth, efficient, and consistent across different machines and time periods.The template is built with a focus on minimal manual interaction for environment synchronization, allowing developers to dive straight into coding. Options for working in a local isolated environment or within a Docker container are provided.
